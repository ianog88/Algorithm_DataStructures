## Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains code files of the implementation of common data structures and algorithms. This corresponds to the learning outcomes of the modules: 
-Algorithms and Data Structures 1 (OOSW H3001) 
-Algorithms and Data Structures 2 (OOSW H3002)

### Algorithms (algorithms_test.ipynb)
This notebook contains the implementation of recursive, sorting and searching algorithms with performance based comparisons. 

### Data Structures 
All data structures were implemented in C++ as per the module descriptions. The following data structures were included:
-Array
-Binary Tree
-Graph
-Hash Table 
-Heap
-Linked List 
-Queue
-Stack
