## Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains code files of the implementation of common data structures and algorithms. This corresponds to the learning outcomes of the modules: 
- [Algorithms and Data Structures 1 (OOSW H3001)](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/oosw-h3001-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures 2 (OOSW H3002)](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/oosw-h3002-algorithms-and-data-structures-2/)

### Algorithms ([algorithms_test.ipynb](algorithms_test.ipynb))
This notebook contains the implementation of recursive, sorting and searching algorithms with performance based comparisons. 

### Data Structures 
All data structures were implemented in C++ as per the module descriptions. The following data structures were included:
- Array ([array.cpp](array.cpp))
- Binary Tree ([binary_tree.cpp](binary_tree.cpp))
- Graph ([graph.cpp](graph.cpp))
- Hash Table ([hash_table.cpp](hash_table.cpp))
- Heap ([heap.cpp](heap.cpp))
- Linked List ([linked_list.cpp](linked_list.cpp))
- Queue ([queue.cpp](queue.cpp))
- Stack ([stack.cpp](stack.cpp))
